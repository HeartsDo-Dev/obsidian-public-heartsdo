_Culture should be accessible without any frontier, and this is one of the reasons why Internet exist._

👋 Hello, my name is HeartsDo on the internet but you can also call Julien which is my first name in real life, I am currently 21 years old!  
🇫🇷 I am French :p.  
💕 I am passionate about computers, anime, video games and music.  
💻 On computers, I'm a little bit of everything, from Windows to Linux through the normal usage or servers or even development, I travel in this world to try things.  
🔉 I'm also a right-to-left volunteer:

- Translation administrator and patroller on the Miraheze Meta coordination wiki.

🕹️ Otherwise, my rest of the time is spent in culture (I said only video games um yes but that is not all):

- I spend a part on video games (GTA, Jak & Dakster, Genshin Inpact, osu!, A Hat in Time).
- The other part, I spend it in the Anime ones (Sword Art Online, BOFURI, Dimension W, Demon Slayer).
- And the last in the Webtoon (only on the service created by LINE but maybe I should push further one day 🤔) (Unordinary, Au fil du monde, Watermelon).

In short, my life on the Internet is full but I like it 🙃.
